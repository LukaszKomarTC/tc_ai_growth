# SESSION LOG — append-only breadcrumbs

## 2026-08-03

Completed
- Weekly report run#22 verified (status=0/SUCCESS, ledger ok) — first production Monday through the validator
- Production Baseline v1 recorded (144a173)
- WP-CONSOLE-USABILITY spec v1+v2 (69ea559)
- Deploy-script provenance fix (d260726) — found by U1 dry-run
- Console U1 fix round (63448f3): stream keepalive, nav truth, durable evidence store (TC_DB_PATH)
- Console redeployed twice (d260726 → 63448f3), U1 ACCEPTED in-browser (f222f03; evidence run#24)
- /project protocol adopted and seeded (19ef4b1)
- Protocol v1.1: chat-is-not-canon invariant, multi-engineer rules, reviewer bundles; docs/STANDING-CAUTIONS.md created (DO_NOT_RESTORE backup warning was chat-only until now)
- Codex governance onboarding read (at baf81b6): found HANDOFF stale main pin + wrong "3 doc-only" drift claim — both conceded; HANDOFF corrected with verified drift statement; protocol gains no-self-invalidating-pins corollary
- Reviewer gained GitHub READ connector (no write, by design); CODEX-1 refined to Repository Auditor role with validation task: docs-only PR modernizing WP-CONSOLE-DEPLOYMENT.md
- PR #67 (Codex): runbook modernized — lead-reviewed (193 green on branch), rebase-merged cd4623f. Full governed loop proven; CODEX-1 DECIDED. Found: shared GitHub identity blocks same-account approvals (recorded in PROTOCOL); new ops rule: retain N-1 release worktree until next successful deploy

- U2 EXECUTED: ops.tossacycling.com live (IONOS DNS + Plesk subdomain + Let's Encrypt + Apache-only proxy — no nginx on box, rate-limit deviation recorded; htpasswd perms fix). Verified through URL: SMTP + 114.9s scan (run#27). Token rotated (F4 closed). Logout built + tested (194 green). RUNBOOK-CONSOLE.md written

Current
- U2-F: one Console redeploy pending (ships Sign out) -> closes U2

Blocked
- Nothing hard; business queue on owner (see OWNER_QUEUE.md)

Next
- U2 A–F → runbook; then U3a artifact persistence
